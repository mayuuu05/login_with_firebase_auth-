## Firebase Authentication

### 1. Login and Sign-Up Page

The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure user login and sign-up. The following services are integrated:

- **Email/Password Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in using their email address and a secure password.
- **Password Reset:** Allows users to reset their password if they forget it.
- **Account Management:** Users can update their account details, including email and password.


### 2. Implementation

- **Firebase Setup:** Firebase Authentication is set up in the app using the Firebase SDK. Make sure to configure Firebase in your project by adding your `google-services.json` (for Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) to the respective platform directories.
- **Login UI:** The login page provides fields for email and password input, along with buttons for logging in and signing up. The design is user-friendly, with validation to ensure correct input formats.
- **Sign-Up UI:** The sign-up page allows new users to create an account by entering their email, password, and other required information. Upon successful sign-up, users are automatically logged in and redirected to the main chat interface.
